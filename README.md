# College Bookstore: Power To The People ‚úäüèΩ
_A project by Chris Nevers and Albara Mehene_


This application provides students with a place to sell and buy textbooks.
Students create profiles with their email. They are then allowed to create
postings of their books. When users find a textbook they are looking for,
they are presented with all the copies in our inventory. They can see the
condition and price of each book. They may contact the seller to haggle or
purchase the book.
